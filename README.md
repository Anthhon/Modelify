# Modelify

`Modelify` is a web-tool which should speed-up the `model.py` creation/building stage in Django applications. It has a simple web-interface which should be accessed in a static-page which uses `Java Script` to generate all the code.

# Features/Project Roadmap

- [X] Creating custom `classes` and `fields` within itself
- [X] Generate basic code to `classes` and `fields`
- [X] Store `class` names to be used as links to be used as `Foreign Keys`
